# Luxembot

"Is that in Germany?"

Every American of Luxembourgian ancestry knows the pain of having to explain that Luxembourg is indeed a country in Europe (not a city) that has its own unique history and culture. Luxembot is a simple twitterbot that is designed to solve the problem of general ignorance about Luxembourg.

It was mainly conceived of as a way to become familiar with Docker and containers, and to get more experience using Twitter's REST API.
